# AutoGPT-TOT 🚀

AutoGPT-TOT is an active open-source project aimed at integrating AutoGPT with Tree of Thoughts (ToT) to enable groundbreaking reasoning capabilities. We are excited about the prospects of combining the strength of these technologies and would love for you to join us in this journey! 

## Project Overview 🌐
This project seeks to revolutionize the way AI reasoning is performed. By combining the power of AutoGPT with the intelligent structure of ToT, we aim to create a system that not only generates human-like text but also demonstrates enhanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. 

## Getting Started 🎬

Here are the steps to get started with AutoGPT-TOT:

```
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/autogpt-tot
cd Auto-GPT 
... # follow autogpt instructions add api key add search key etc
python3 main.py
```

After cloning the repository, follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and use the project.

## Roadmap 🗺️

Our roadmap for AutoGPT-TOT is as follows:

1. **Integration of AutoGPT with ToT**: Our immediate goal is to successfully integrate AutoGPT with Tree of Thoughts. 

2. **Enhancement of Reasoning Capabilities**: Post integration, we plan to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the AI.


- Implement eval states in agent config file

- Replace regular response with tree of thoughts.solve method, maybe add in dynamic rewards

- make tree of thought configs dynamic and shapeless and metamorphic
